About the dataset
Iris is a well-known multiclass dataset. It contains 3 classes of flowers with 50 examples each. There are a total of 4 features for each flower.

Step 1: Loading the data
Load the iris dataset using datasets.load_iris()
Investigate the data structure with .keys()
Construct a dataframe from the dataset
Create a 'target' and a 'class' column that contains the target names and values
Display a random sample of the dataframe
In [ ]:
def load_data():
    #load the dataset
    #return the dataset
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
assert load_data()['data'].shape == (150,4)
In [ ]:
dataset = load_data()
load_data().feature_names
In [ ]:
def dataset_to_pandas():
    #put the dataset into a pandas DF using the feature names as columnsÃ§
    #rename the column name so the dont include the '(cm)'
    #add 2 columns one with the target and another with the target_names
    
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
df = dataset_to_pandas()
assert df['sepal length'].shape == (150,)
assert df['sepal width'].shape == (150,)
assert df['petal length'].shape == (150,)
assert df['petal width'].shape == (150,)
assert df['target'].shape == (150,)
assert df['class'].shape == (150,)
Question
Find the X and y values we're looking for. Notice that y is categorical and thus, we could one-hot encode it if we are looking at class or we can just pick target. In order to one hot encode we have to re-shape y it using the .get_dummies function.

For the purpose of this exercise, do not use hot encoding, go only for target but think about if you have to drop it somewhere or not...
In [ ]:
df_iris = dataset_to_pandas()
In [ ]:
def ohe():
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
ohe_data = ohe()

assert ohe_data.shape == (150,8)
Step 2: Setting up supervised learning problem (selecting features)
Feature selection is an essential step in improving a model's perfromance. In the first version of the model we will use the 'sepal length' and 'sepal width' as predicting features. Later we will see the effect of adding additional features.

Assign the values of the 'target' to Y as a numpy array
Assign the remaining feature values to X as a numpy array
Check the shape of X and Y. Check the first few values.
Can we confirm our X and Y are created correctly?
In [ ]:
def target_to_numpy():
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
def data_to_numpy():
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
Y = target_to_numpy()
X = data_to_numpy()
assert isinstance(Y, np.ndarray)
assert isinstance(X, np.ndarray)
assert X.shape == (150,2)
In [ ]:
#your code here
X = df_iris[['sepal length', 'sepal width']].values
print(X.shape)
X[:5]
Step 3: Creating the first model
In lecture we learned about creating a train and test datasets, normalizing, and fitting a model. In this step we will see how to build a simple version of this.

We have to be careful when constructing our train and test datasets. First, when we create train and test datasets we have to be careful that we always have the same datapoints in each set. Otherwise our results won't be reproduceable or we might introduce a bias into our model.

We also need to be attentive to when we normalize the data. What would be the effect of normalizing the data (i.e. with StandardScaler to a range between 0 - 1) before we create our train and test sets? Effectively we would use information in the test set to structure the values in the training set and vice versa. Therefore normalizing train and test independently is the preferred method.

Create X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test using train_test_split() with an 80/20 train/test split. Look in the SKLearn documentation to understand how the function works.
Inspect the first few rows of X_train.
Run the cell a few times. Do the first few rows change?
What option can we use in train_test_split() to stop this from happening?
Normalize the train and test datasets with StandardScaler
We can fit the transform with .fit() and .transform() to apply it. Look in the documentation for an esample of how to do this.
Does it make sense to normalize Y_train and Y_test?
Initalize a LogisticRegression() model and use the .fit() method to initalize the first model.
We will pass the X_train and Y_train variables to the .fit() method.
Once the model is fit, use the .predict() with the X_test and save the output as predictions.
In [ ]:
#split train and test data 80/20
#your code here
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = 0,0,0,0

# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()

print(X_train.shape)
print(Y_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
print(Y_test.shape)
In [ ]:
assert X_train.shape == (120,2)
assert Y_train.shape == (120,)
assert X_test.shape  == (30,2)
assert Y_test.shape  == (30,)
In [ ]:
#normalize the dataset
#your code here

#create and fit the scaler object on the training data
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()

X_train[:5]
In [ ]:
assert np.amin(X_train) >= -2.5
assert np.amax(X_train) <= 3.2
assert np.amin(X_test) >= -2
assert np.amin(X_test) <= 2.75
In [ ]:
#initalize and fit with Logistic Regression
prediction = 0
#your code here

#initalize the logistic regressor
#make predictions
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
assert predictions.shape == (30,)
Step 4: Evaluate the frist model's predictions
We will learn more about how to evaluate the performance of a classifier in later lessons. For now we will use % accuracy as our metric. It is important to know that this metric only helps us understand the specific performance of our model and not, for example, where we can improve it, or where it already perfoms well.

Use .score() to evaluate the performance of our first model.
In [ ]:
score = 0
#evaluating the performace of our first model
#your code here
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
assert score >=0.7
In [ ]:
assert score >=0.72
In [ ]:
assert score >=0.73
Step 5: Crossvalidation of the model
Our first model achived ~90% accruacy. This is quite good. How do we know it is reproducable? If we run the model again and our performance is 85% which is correct? And what about improving our model? Can you think of one thing we can do to potentially improve the model?

Crossvalidation
Corssvalidation is when we create multiple X and Y datasets. On each dataset we train and fit the model. We then average the results and return a 'crossvalidated' accruacy.

Initalize a new version of the model you trained above with the same paramters.
Use cross_validate() to run the model with 5 crossvalidation folds.
In [ ]:
#model with cross validation
#your code here

#cross validate the training set
clf_cv = 0
CV = 0
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()

def print_scores(cv):
    #print out cross validation scores
    [print('Crossvalidation fold: {}  Accruacy: {}'.format(n, score)) for n, score in enumerate(cv['test_score'])]
    #print out the mean of the cross validation
    print('Mean train cross validation score {}'.format(cv['test_score'].mean()))
    
print_scores(cv)
In [ ]:
assert len(cv['test_score']) == 5
assert max(cv['test_score']) >= 0.85
assert min(cv['test_score']) >= 0.69
assert cv['test_score'].mean() >= 0.77
Step 6: Creating an end to end ML pipeline
Congraulations you've trained, crossvalidated, predicted, and evaluated your frist classifier. Now that you understand the basic steps we will look at a way to combine all these steps together.

Before we go further think about what you would have to do if you wanted to change the model. Intalize a new model, change the vairables, redo the cross validation...etc. Seems like a lot. And when we have to change lots of code it is easy to make mistakes. And what if you wanted to try many models and see which one performed best? Or try changing many different features? How could you do it without writing each one out as we have?

The solution is to use SKLearn's pipeline class. A pipeline is an object that will execute the various steps in the machine learning process. We can choose what elements we want in the pipeline and those that we do not. Once setup, we can rapidly change models, or input data and have it return our results in an ordered way.

Initalize a scaler and a classifer object like we did previously.
Use the make_pipeline() function to construct a transofmraiton pipeline for the scaler and the classifier
Input the pipeline object to the cross_validator and evaluate with 5 folds.
Print out your results (hint: make a function for repetitve tasks like printing)
In [ ]:
#define the scaler
#define the classifier
#make the pipeline
#run the cross validation
#print results
scaler = 0
classifier = 0
pipe = 0
scores = 0
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
In [ ]:
assert type(pipe) == type(make_pipeline(scaler, classifier))
assert len(cv['test_score']) == 5
assert max(cv['test_score']) >= 0.83
assert min(cv['test_score']) >= 0.69
assert cv['test_score'].mean() >= 0.74
Challenge Exercise
In this notebook we only used two features to predict the class of the flower. We also did not do any hypter parameter tuning. The challenge is to impove the prediction results. Some ideas we can try:

Add features to the input and run the cross validation pipeline
Investigate how to use GridSearchCV, a powerful funtion that searches through hyperparmetrs and does cross validation.
Hint: Input the pipeline directly into GridSearchCV
Try a different models like RandomForest or SVM.
